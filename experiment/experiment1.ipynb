My first tour was entirely in Rajasthan, other than the start and end of the tour in Delhi, India’s capital city. Udaipur’s City Palace was my favorite of the palaces I visited in India. If you have time to add Varanasi,\\xa0India’s oldest and most holy city is unlike anywhere I have ever been.

The Indian Railway is a huge part of the infrastructure of India and we recommend experiencing a rail journey at least once.
